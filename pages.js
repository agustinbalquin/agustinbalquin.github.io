Let's say for example you have a single mother. She works maybe one or two jobs, or shes just generally busy. She needs to buy something for her child such as a new crib or baby formula so she orders it online. It does come in the next day as expected but unfortunately she's not home to sign off on the package. The delivery man knocks on the door, sees that noone is home, places a note on the door, and leaves. Now the mother has to wait another 3 days or spend time out of her day to head over to the post office."}]}]
