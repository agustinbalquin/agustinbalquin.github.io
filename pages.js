Let's say for example you have a single mother. She works maybe one or two jobs, or shes just generally busy. She needs to buy something for her child such as a new crib or baby formula so she orders it online. It does come in the next day as expected but unfortunately she's not home to sign off on the package. The delivery man knocks on the door, sees that noone is home, places a note on the door, and leaves. Now the mother has to wait another 3 days or spend time out of her day to head over to the post office."]},{"title":"xB.10.21.16-CitrusHack16","what":{"Hackathon":{"University of California, Riverside":"where","Mentored":"projects"},"information":{"true":"projects","Heroku":"hosted on"}},"how":["I had plenty of assignments and work on my plate this weekend so I sat this one out.","My friends heading the event did a great job planning and organizing. Food and beverages were always being served and the venue was accomodating. Hack rooms were all throughout Chung hall provided a lot of space for hackers to settle in and get comfortable.","My mentees were freshmen who wanted help building a web application. The group decided to make an online multiplayer game. They initially wanted to make a messenger chatbot but hadn't fully grasped important concepts yet and I didn't have enough time to stay at the venue. Nevertheless, they were able to create a functioning game."]},{"title":"xC.10.25.16-StockPrediction","what":{"MachineLearning":{"University of California, Riverside":"where","Stock Prediction Software":"project","TensorFlow":"framework"},"information":{"true":"Neural Networks","profits":"yes"}},"how":["I created software to help detect the fluctuations in a specific field of the stock market.","The market is in a specific volatile section regarding pharmaceuticals.","It determines the best options for when to sell units at the appropriate time."]},{"title":"xD.1.13.17-Hack@UCI","what":{"IoT Greenhouse":{"University of California, Irvine":"where","Iot Greenhouse":"project","NodeRed":"framework"},"information":{"true":"Arduino","profits":"yes"}},"how":["I attended HackUCI this year to visit some colleagues who were organizing the Hackathon as well as some who were participating.","One of them had an idea to create a IoT greenhouse and needed some webdevelopment to be done.","I had previously worked with the Node-Red platform before and knew how to configure flows and monitor the enpoints to build a sufficient ui.","I created the main layout for the system which included Temperature, Moisture, and Humididty charts and gauges for the dashboard.","Unfortunately I had prior commitments I had to attend to and an important meeting the next day so I had to leave early.","However their team picked up a freshman hacker from UCSD who was starting her first hackathon.","We helped her get set up with the system and she was able to complete the job.","I'm glad I was able to be of assistance as the team won the Best IoT Category."]},{"title":"xE.1.20.17-SBHacks3","what":{"BudgetBlock":{"University of California, Santa Barbara":"where","Distributed Filesystem BlockChain":"project","IBM Bluemix":"API"},"information":{"very":"secure"}},"how":["SBHacks is always an event to look forward to. I came to Santa Barbara last year because I heard great things about their first hackathon. My friends, Jiunn Siow and Gustavo Correa, and I ended up winning the IBM IoT category.","We were on different projects this time and I chose to work with the Bluemix platform once again to create a blockchain for distributed data management.","The process itself was very tedious even after I figured out how to use their API.","I am however impressed with the level of security that a blockchain provides. It uses a system of peers that carry out a specific task based on the created hyperledger fabric.","The peers communicate with one another and withold the information until they come to an agreement that the user request is valid.","I had to set up a large amount of certificates before completeing the backend services.","I didn't have much time to make it look fancy, but I created a sample application that portrayed the use of the blockchain.","BudgetBlock, a web application for students to use to manage their finances and pay for student loans, rent, and bills all safely and securely."]},{"title":"xF.2.12.17","what":{"Apeeling Eats":{"California State Polytechnic University, Pomona":"where","User generated Sentiment Analysis":"project","IBM Watson, TensorFlow, ReactJS":"framework"},"information":{"Prize":"First Place Winner"}},"how":["We went to HackPoly with not much of an idea what to create.","Eventually our team consisted of 4 people, 2 beginners, my friend, and myself.","We first wanted to create","7 hours into the hackathon we eventually came up with the idea of creating user generated menus.","This gives us unobstructed ratings for food rather than restaurants.","Restaurants are normally rated based on the venue, service, location. This allows us to give ratings with respect to specific food.","Using this it is possible to find hidden gems throughout the city. One can now possibly find a 5-star dish at a 3-star restaurant.","Also this allows smaller businesses whose menu's are more volatile by allowing them to see the success of certain items. A business can be doing well one month, but fall out of flavor the next month.","This allows businesses to be more adaptive and more efficient, cutting costs and changing recipes and ingredients if a certain item isnt faring well.","We developed our own Convolutional Neural Network to analyze the user reviews","We won the Grand Prize at HackPoly 2017"]}]
