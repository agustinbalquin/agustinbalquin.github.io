Let's say for example you have a single mother. She works maybe one or two jobs, or shes just generally busy. She needs to buy something for her child such as a new crib or baby formula so she orders it online. It does come in the next day as expected but unfortunately she's not home to sign off on the package. The delivery man knocks on the door, sees that noone is home, places a note on the door, and leaves. Now the mother has to wait another 3 days or spend time out of her day to head over to the post office."]},{"title":"About","what":{"education":{"University of California, Riverside":"where","Computer Science and Engineering":"studies","3.8":"GPA","agustinbalquin":"github"},"interests":{"true":"hackathons","false":"sleep"}},"how":["Studying Computer Science and Enginering at University of California, Riverside."]},{"title":"c.10.25.16-StockPrediction","what":{"MachineLearning":{"University of California, Riverside":"where","Stock Prediction Software":"project","TensorFlow":"framework"},"information":{"true":"Neural Networks","profits":"yes"}},"how":["I created software to help detect the fluctuations in a specific field of the stock market.","The market is in a specific volatile section regarding pharmaceuticals.","It determines the best options for when to sell units at the appropriate time."]}]
